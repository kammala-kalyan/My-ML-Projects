## `1`. E-Commerce Customers - Linear Regression Project 

This project analyzes customer data from an e-commerce company to predict the yearly amount spent by a customer.

## 📂 Dataset
- [Dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/srolka/ecommerce-customers)
  
## What I did:
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Features Selected (Based on Correlation)
- Visualized correlations using pairplot and heatmap
- Trained a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated with MAE, RMSE, and R² scores
- Achieved **1.45% average percent error**

## `2`. 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts house prices based on various features like area, number of rooms, and available amenities.

## 📂 Dataset
- [Dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction/)
  
## 🛠️ What I Did
- Converted **'yes'/'no'** values to `1/0` to make them usable by the model.
- Simplified **furnishing status** to binary values.
- Applied **log transformation** on price to handle skewness.
- Selected features based on correlation with price.
- Trained a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices.

## 📈 Output
- Evaluated the model using R² and RMSE.
- Visualized predictions and residuals to understand model performance.
