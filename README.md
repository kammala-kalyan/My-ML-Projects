- This repository contains the machine learning projects I practice and learn from.  
- I'll be uploading notebooks, datasets, and code as I explore different ML concepts.

## `1`. E-Commerce Customers - Linear Regression Project 📈

This project analyzes customer data from an e-commerce company to predict the yearly amount spent by a customer.

## What I did:
- Explored the dataset using pandas and seaborn.
- Visualized relationships between features.
- Built a linear regression model to predict `Yearly Amount Spent`.
- Evaluated the model using error metrics and residual plots.

## `2`. 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts house prices based on various features like area, number of rooms, and available amenities.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains details such as:
- Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Stories
- Amenities: main road access, guestroom, basement, hot water heating, air conditioning, etc.
- Categorical feature: Furnishing status
- [Dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction/)
  
## 🛠️ What I Did
- Converted **'yes'/'no'** values to `1/0` to make them usable by the model.
- Simplified **furnishing status** to binary values.
- Applied **log transformation** on price to handle skewness.
- Selected features based on correlation with price.
- Trained a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices.

## 📈 Output
- Evaluated the model using R² and RMSE.
- Visualized predictions and residuals to understand model performance.
