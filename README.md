This repository contains the machine learning projects I practice and learn from.  
I'll be uploading notebooks, datasets, and code as I explore different ML concepts.

## `1`. E-Commerce Customers - Linear Regression Project ðŸ“ˆ

This project analyzes customer data from an e-commerce company to predict the yearly amount spent by a customer.

## What I did:
- Explored the dataset using pandas and seaborn.
- Visualized relationships between features.
- Built a linear regression model to predict `Yearly Amount Spent`.
- Evaluated the model using error metrics and residual plots.

This was done as part of my machine learning practice.
