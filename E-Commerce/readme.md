## `1`. E-Commerce Customers - Linear Regression Project 

This project analyzes customer data from an e-commerce company to predict the yearly amount spent by a customer.

### ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- [Dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/srolka/ecommerce-customers)
  
### What I did:
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Features Selected (Based on Correlation)
- Visualized correlations using pairplot and heatmap
- Trained a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated with MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² scores
- Achieved **1.45% average percent error**

### Output & Evaluation
- Evaluation was done on test data (20%) using standard regression metrics.

| Metric                  | Value     |
| ----------------------- | --------- |
| Train RÂ² Score          | 0.9827    |
| Test RÂ² Score           | 0.9892    |
| Mean Absolute Error     | Low       |
| Root Mean Squared Error | Low       |
| Avg Percent Error     | **1.45%** |

#### Interpretation:

- The model predicts yearly customer spending with very high accuracy and minimal error.
- No signs of overfitting were found (Test RÂ² > Train RÂ²).

#### Model Evaluation: Actual vs Predicted

</p>

3. **Selected Relevant Features**
   - Based on heatmap & pairplot, selected:
     ```
     ['Avg. Session Length', 'Time on App', 'Time on Website', 'Length of Membership']
     ```
   - Target: `Yearly Amount Spent`

4. **Trained a Linear Regression Model**
   - Split data into training and test sets (80-20)
   - Trained using `LinearRegression()` from scikit-learn

5. **Evaluated the Model**
   - Computed:
     - `Train RÂ²` Score â†’ 0.9827  
     - `Test RÂ²` Score â†’ 0.9892  
     - Mean Absolute Error and RMSE â†’ Very Low  
     - **Average Percent Error** â†’ Just **1.45%**

## Conclusion

This mini project gave me hands-on practice with **Linear Regression** and taught me how customer features can be used to accurately predict business metrics like **yearly spending**.  
With **simple preprocessing** and **feature selection**, I built a powerful regression model with **minimal error** â€” making it a great example of applying ML to real-world business problems.
