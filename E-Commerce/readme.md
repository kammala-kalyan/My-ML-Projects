## `1`. E-Commerce Customers â€“ Linear Regression

This dataset contains customer information for an e-commerce platform, including behavioral and spending data. Each row represents one customer, and the goal is to predict the yearly amount spent by a customer based on their engagement with the website and app.

It includes features like average session length, time on app, length of membership, and more â€” useful for building a linear regression model to understand key drivers of customer spending.

### ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- [Dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/srolka/ecommerce-customers)

- **500 rows** â†’ Each row = one customer  
- **8 columns** â†’ Features about customer activity, location, and spending


### Features and Their Meaning

| Feature Name            | Description                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Email`                | Customer's email address                                    |
| `Address`              | Physical location (not used in modeling)                   |
| `Avatar`               | Profile picture file (not used in modeling)                |
| `Avg. Session Length`  | Average session duration on the website                    |
| `Time on App`          | Time spent on the mobile app                               |
| `Time on Website`      | Time spent on the website                                  |
| `Length of Membership` | How long the customer has been with the company            |
| `Yearly Amount Spent`  | Target variable â€“ total yearly spending by the customer     |

### What I Wanted to Practice

- Building and interpreting a **Linear Regression model**
- Understanding **correlation** between user behavior and spending
- Evaluating predictions with **MAE, RMSE, and RÂ²**
- Visualizing **actual vs predicted** and calculating **percent error**

### Work Flow with Steps Followed:

1. **Loaded and Inspected the Data**
   - Loaded using pandas and checked for missing/null values
   - Used `.describe()` to get a statistical summary

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Plotted pairplot to explore feature relationships
   - Generated a correlation heatmap to identify strong predictors

</p>

3. **Visualized Key Feature Relationships**
   - Created scatter plots between `Yearly Amount Spent` and:
     - `Avg. Session Length`
     - `Time on App`
     - `Length of Membership`

</p>

4. **Selected Features & Created Train/Test Split**
   - Based on correlation and scatter plots, selected:
     ```
     ['Avg. Session Length', 'Time on App', 'Length of Membership']
     ```
   - Used `train_test_split()` to split data 80% train and 20% test

5. **Trained Linear Regression Model**
   - Fitted `LinearRegression()` model on training data
   - Extracted coefficients to interpret feature importance

6. **Made Predictions & Evaluated the Model**
   - Predicted `Yearly Amount Spent` on test data
   - Calculated:
     - Mean Absolute Error: 6.84602715809049
     - Mean Squared Error: 78.86825975788848
     - Root Mean Squared Error: 8.880780357484836
     - Percent Error â‰ˆ **1.45%**
     - Train RÂ² = 0.9887  
     - Test RÂ²  = 0.9855

   - Plotted regression line vs actual values
   - Created scatter plot of actual vs predicted
   - Displayed residual heatmap

## Conclusion

This mini project gave me hands-on practice with **Linear Regression** and taught me how customer features can be used to accurately predict business metrics like **yearly spending**.  
With **simple preprocessing** and **feature selection**, I built a powerful regression model with **minimal error** â€” making it a great example of applying ML to real-world business problems.
