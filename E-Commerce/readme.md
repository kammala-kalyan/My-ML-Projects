## `1`. E-Commerce Customers - Linear Regression Project 

This project analyzes customer data from an e-commerce company to predict the yearly amount spent by a customer.

### ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- [Dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/srolka/ecommerce-customers)
  
### What I did:
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Features Selected (Based on Correlation)
- Visualized correlations using pairplot and heatmap
- Trained a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated with MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² scores
- Achieved **1.45% average percent error**

### Output & Evaluation
- Evaluation was done on test data (20%) using standard regression metrics.

| Metric                  | Value     |
| ----------------------- | --------- |
| Train RÂ² Score          | 0.9827    |
| Test RÂ² Score           | 0.9892    |
| Mean Absolute Error     | Low       |
| Root Mean Squared Error | Low       |
| Avg Percent Error     | **1.45%** |

#### Interpretation:

- The model predicts yearly customer spending with very high accuracy and minimal error.
- No signs of overfitting were found (Test RÂ² > Train RÂ²).

#### Model Evaluation: Actual vs Predicted

## `1`. E-Commerce Customers â€“ Linear Regression

This project analyzes **customer behavior and spending** from an e-commerce company.  
The goal was to build a linear regression model to predict how much a customer is likely to spend annually based on their profile.

### ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- [Dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/srolka/ecommerce-customers)

- **500 rows** â†’ Each row = one customer  
- **8 columns** â†’ Features about customer activity, location, and time spent

### Features and Their Meaning

| Feature Name            | Description                                               |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `Email`                | Customerâ€™s email ID                                       |
| `Address`              | Physical address                                          |
| `Avatar`               | Profile image (not used in modeling)                      |
| `Avg. Session Length`  | Average session duration on the website                   |
| `Time on App`          | Time spent on the mobile app                              |
| `Time on Website`      | Time spent on the website                                 |
| `Length of Membership` | How long the customer has been with the company           |
| `Yearly Amount Spent`  | Target variable â€“ total yearly spending (in dollars)      |

### What I Wanted to Practice

- **Linear Regression**: To build a predictive model using continuous input features  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Understand feature impact on target  
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like RÂ², MAE, RMSE, and visual comparisons  
- **Data Interpretation**: Translate numeric insights into business understanding

---

### Work Flow with Steps Followed:

1. **Loaded and Explored the Data**
   - Imported dataset using `pandas`
   - Checked structure, null values, and datatypes

2. **Performed Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Plotted a `pairplot` to view relationships among all numerical features
   - Generated a `correlation heatmap` to detect strong associations

</p>

3. **Selected Relevant Features**
   - Based on heatmap & pairplot, selected:
     ```
     ['Avg. Session Length', 'Time on App', 'Time on Website', 'Length of Membership']
     ```
   - Target: `Yearly Amount Spent`

4. **Trained a Linear Regression Model**
   - Split data into training and test sets (80-20)
   - Trained using `LinearRegression()` from scikit-learn

5. **Evaluated the Model**
   - Computed:
     - `Train RÂ²` Score â†’ 0.9827  
     - `Test RÂ²` Score â†’ 0.9892  
     - Mean Absolute Error and RMSE â†’ Very Low  
     - **Average Percent Error** â†’ Just **1.45%**

## Conclusion

This mini project gave me hands-on practice with **Linear Regression** and taught me how customer features can be used to accurately predict business metrics like **yearly spending**.  
With **simple preprocessing** and **feature selection**, I built a powerful regression model with **minimal error** â€” making it a great example of applying ML to real-world business problems.
